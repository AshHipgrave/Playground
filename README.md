# Playground

Basic framework for messing around with various game-dev and rendering related topics.  

*CommonLib* - Provides platform and API abstractions and general boilerplate code.   
*PlaygroundGameApp* - Place to throw code currently being prototyped (hopefully) without having to worry about the underlying platform/graphics API etc.
