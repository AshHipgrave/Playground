# Playground

Basic framework for messing around with various game-dev and rendering related topics.  

*MathLib* - Provides common math functions (Vectors, Matrix etc)  
  
*CommonLib* - Provides platform and API abstractions and general boilerplate code.  
  
*PlaygroundGameApp* - Place to throw code currently being prototyped (hopefully) without having to worry about the underlying platform/graphics API etc.  
  
*Utils/MathLib_UnitTests* - Unit testing library for MathLib to ensure the library works correctly and isn't caclulating anything.
